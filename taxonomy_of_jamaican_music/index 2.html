        The inspiration for this project begins in a very personal place. I was born in Kingston, Jamaica and moved to America when I was 4. I lived in Boston, MA until I was 11, and then West Palm Beach, FL for my teenage years. Had I grew up little further south in Ft. Lauderdale for example I would have been exposed to more Jamaican culture growing up. However, since I didn’t grow up with any Jamaican peers, my main exposure to the culture was through my Mom, so at that point I didn’t see Jamaican culture as anything particularly cool.

        <br />
        Once I met my friend Nile who was born in America, but moved to Jamaica when he was 4, I discovered different aspects of Jamaican culture and music was one of the main channels through which this happened. We watched YouTube videos of the biggest clashes from Sting back in the ’90s. He’d explain the subtleties of sound system culture like what a dubplate is and their significance to the sound clashes.

        In America a lot of times Jamaican music is put under the umbrella of reggae, but I realized that there is a long history of Jamaican music prior to and post reggae. I also saw how the evolution of Jamaican music often paralleled shifts within the political climate of the country. Throughout the years Jamaican music also significantly influenced some of the most popular music genres from around the world. 
        <br />
        <br />
        My goal with this project is to create an interactive map of Jamaican music for user to explore Jamaican music from both auditory and informational perspectives.

        Mento draws on musical traditions brought by West African slaves. They also absorbed European musical traditions, creating a new form. Typically featuring acoustic instruments, such as guitar, banjo, hand drums, and the rhumba box—a large mbira in the shape of a box that can be sat on while played. The lyrics of mento songs often deal with aspects of everyday life in a light-hearted and humorous way. Many comment on poverty, poor housing, and other social issues. Thinly veiled sexual references and innuendo are also common. Although the treatment of such subjects in mento is comparatively innocent, their appearance has sometimes been seen as a precursor of the slackness found in modern <a href="#">dancehall</a>.
